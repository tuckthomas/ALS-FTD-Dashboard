# ALS-FTD-Dashboard
ALS/FTD Research Dashboard.

As part of a non-profit/volunteer contribution, this is the repository to an upcoming Dashboard summarizing the current state of ALS/FTD research, with a preliminary focus on familial ALS/FTD.

# Current State:
This is a work in progress. The API functionaltiy is working with an initial amount of identifed fields that were requested, though additional fields will be added soon.

The front-end has not yet been developed. I am still contimplating the best front-end approach. Whether it be with custom graphs, charts, and tables. Though, I am currently leaning towards using Metabase as the Dashboard front-end.

# Requirements:
1. Python 3.9
2. More to be added  soon from requirements.txt....
